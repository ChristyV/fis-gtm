		 *	driven by heartbeat on Tru64, AIX, Solaris and HPUX. The periodic heartbeat handler cannot pop as
		 *	it is a SIGALRM handler and cannot nest while we are already in a SIGALRM handler for the wcs_clean_dbsync.
		 *   	Were this to happen, we could end up waiting for crit, not being able to interrupt the wait
		 *   	with a timeout resulting in a hang until crit became available.

		 *   5) We are in gtm_malloc. Don't want to recurse on malloc.
		 * Other deadlock causing conditions that need to be taken care of
