GT.M relies on CMake to generate the Makefiles to build GT.M from source. The
prerequisites are CMake (at least 2.8.5), GNU make (at least 3.81), Linux
(either x86 or x86_64), Unicode include files and GPG. Unicode include files
are automatically installed if ICU is installed. GPG include files require
installing the GNUPG and related library development packages. Debian 6, Ubuntu
12.04 LTS and RHEL 6.0 were used to do the test builds for this distribution.
The default ICU and GPG packages were taken from the distribution repositories.

To build GT.M for Linux, do the following steps:

1. Fulfill the pre-requisites
   Install developement libraries libelf, zlib, libicu, libgpgme, libgpg-error,
   libgcrypt.

   [optional] The GT.M source tarball includes pre-generated files. To generate
   these files requires a binary distribution of GT.M.  You can download GT.M
   from http://sourceforge.net/projects/fis-gtm/ Unpack the tar file and run
   the configure script as root. Note: the tar file unpacks everything into
   your current working directory, not a new subdirectory. The Linux Standard
   Base (LSB) install path for GT.M V6.0-002 is /opt/fis-gtm/V6.0-002_i686 or
   /opt/fis-gtm/V6.0-002_x8664.
   $ tar xfz fis-gtm-V6.0-002.tar.gz
   $ sudo sh ./configure

   # Provide the directory path to cmake using
   #   -D GTM_DIST:PATH=$gtm_dist

2. Unpack the GT.M sources
   The GT.M source tarball extracts to a directory with the version number in
   the name, fis-gtm-V6.0-002
   $ tar xfz fis-gtm-V6.0-002.tar.gz
   $ cd fis-gtm-V6.0-002

   You should find this README, LICENSE, COPYING and CMakeLists.txt file and
   sr_* source directories.

3. Building GT.M -
   <fis-gtm-build> can be a sub directory of the source directory,
   fis-gtm-V6.0-002, or any other valid path.

   $ mkdir <fis-gtm-build>
   $ cd <fis-gtm-build>

   # By default the build produces release versions of GT.M. To build a debug
   # version of GT.M supply the following parameter to cmake
   #     -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG
   #
   # Note that the default install location is driven by CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.
   # You can change this when executing cmake
   #     -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/opt/fis-gtm
   #
   $ cmake <path to>/fis-gtm-V6.0-002

   $ make

   $ sudo make install

   $ make clean

4. Packaging GT.M -
   Create a tar file from the installed directory
