/* Macro to cause deferrable interrupts to be deferred recording the cause.
 * If interrupt is already deferred, state is not changed.
 *
 * The normal usage of the below macros is
 *	DEFER_INTERRUPTS
 *	non-interruptible code
 *	ENABLE_INTERRUPTS
 * We want the non-interruptible code to be executed AFTER the SAVE_INTRPT_OK_STATE macro.
 * To enforce this ordering, one would think a read memory barrier is needed in between.
 * But it is not needed. This is because we expect the non-interruptible code to have
 *	a) pointer dereferences OR
 *	b) function calls
 * Either of these will prevent the compiler from reordering the non-interruptible code.
 * Any non-interruptible code that does not have either of the above usages (for e.g. uses C global
 * variables) might be affected by compiler reordering. As of now, there is no known case of such
 * usage and no such usage is anticipated in the future.
 *
 * We dont need to worry about machine reordering as well since there is no shared memory variable
 * involved here (intrpt_ok_state is a process private variable) and even if any reordering occurs
 * they will all be in-flight instructions when the interrupt occurs so the hardware will guarantee
 * all such instructions are completely done or completely discarded before servicing the interrupt
 * which means the interrupt service routine will never see a reordered state of the above code.
